This is a list of some of the things I plan to work on for future releases
of gFTP. If there is something you feel should be included in a future
version of gFTP, please email me about it.

*** TODO FOR 2.0.15 ***
* Check for memory leaks with dmalloc
* DND - be able to resume transfers
* HTTP - keepalive
* HTTP - I am getting complaints about HTTP proxy support is busted
* Profile SSHV2 transfers, they seem really slow to me
* Override options on a per site basis (backend is done, I just have to make
  a user interface for the text and gtk+ port)
* Fix most FIXME's in the code
*** END TODO FOR 2.0.15

* I need to be able to send an event from the core library to the presentation
  layer to have it ask the user a question. I need this for the SSL layer so 
  that if an unknown certificate authority signed the certificate, the user
  can be prompted whether or not to accept it. Also, it would be handy to 
  prompt the user for their password if a bad password was entered. 
* Support tabbed interface in GTK+ port
* Parallel chdir in GTK+ port
* GTK 2.0 port - make 2 buttons in toolbar be the same size as the gnome 2
  icons
* Add option to hide certain files
* Be able to save the state of the transfer queue. Be able to pause transfers.
* For bookmarks, be able to specify a local protocol, host, port, directory
  to connect to
* Show status information in title bar
* -d command line, check if it's a file first, if so download. If not, grab directory
* Add option for @dynamic@ for bookmarks' account
* Playing sounds after certain events or calling external program
* Ratio support
* Recursive directory compares
* Make it be able to download a directory as directory.tar
* Make it execute a program on a url (say rpm -qpi ftp://site.com/file.rpm)
* Full Gnome compatibility.
* Add registered file extensions to options dialog
* VMS directory listings
* Add automatic refresh interval (maybe, this could be used to get around 
  timeouts remote servers may set)
* HTTP: Support CONNECT method in Squid proxy
* Add support for SRP protocol (http://srp.stanford.edu/srp)
* Add support for DAV protocol
* Add support for rsync protocol
* Add support for gss-ftp protocol (and ftp-ssl)
