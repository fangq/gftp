This is a list of some of the things I plan to work on for future releases
of gFTP. If there is something you feel should be included in a future
version of gFTP, please email me about it.

* PATH_MAX may not be defined on the system
* SITE command - give option to not specify SITE

* I need to be able to send an event from the core library to the presentation
  layer to have it ask the user a question. I need this for the SSL layer so 
  that if an unknown certificate authority signed the certificate, the user
  can be prompted whether or not to accept it. Also, it would be handy to 
  prompt the user for their password if a bad password was entered. 
* HTTP - keepalive
* Support tabbed interface in GTK+ port
* Parallel chdir in GTK+ port
* GTK 2.0 port - make 2 buttons in toolbar be the same size as the gnome 2
  icons
* Be able to save the state of the transfer queue. Be able to pause transfers.
* -d command line, check if it's a file first, if so download. If not, grab directory
* Add option for @dynamic@ for bookmarks' account
* Playing sounds after certain events or calling external program
* Ratio support
* Recursive directory compares
* Make it be able to download a directory as directory.tar
* Make it execute a program on a url (say rpm -qpi ftp://site.com/file.rpm)
* Full Gnome compatibility.
* Add registered file extensions to options dialog
* Multiline VMS directory listings
  BIN.DIR;1               
       2/35         24-JUL-2003 10:51:02  [TST,JAQUAY_TST]    (RWE,RWE,RWE,RE)
* HTTP: Support CONNECT method in Squid proxy
* Add support for SRP protocol (http://srp.stanford.edu/srp)
* Add support for DAV protocol
