I am pleased to announce the availability of gFTP 2.0.18rc1. Here is a
summarized list of changes since version 2.0.17. For a full list of changes,
please see the ChangeLog file that is included with the source distribution.

* SSH2: Improved the login code. You no longer need to specify in gFTP the
  path to the sftp-server binary on the remote server. It will now just work
  out of the box for most sites. Also, if the SSH binary is asking a
  question, this question will be relayed back through the gFTP user interface
  so the user can answer it appropriately.
* SSH2: Added support for RSA SecurID passwords
* FTP, SSH2: Added support for preserving the file date/time
* FTP: Fixed IPv6 connection problem
* More 64 bit cleanups
* More largefile fixes
* Fixed detection of SIGCHLD signal when viewing/editing files
* Added remote_lc_time option. The value of LC_TIME can now be overridden on
  a per site basis. This will fix problems parsing the dates in the remote
  directory listings
* Some more GNOME HIG fixes
* Fixed several segfaults in the bookmarks editor
* Save the state of the host, user and port fields in the toolbar
* Fixed compiler errors on OpenBSD and HPUX
* Many other small changes and improvements. See the ChangeLog file in the
  distribution for a detailed list of changes.
* New language translations and updates (bg cs en_CA en_GB es fi he hu ja nl pa
                                         pt_BR ru sq)

I plan on releasing the final 2.0.18 sometime after 11/23/2004. This is mainly
to give the translators time to update their translations. If you find any bugs
in this release, please report them using GNOME's Bugzilla.
