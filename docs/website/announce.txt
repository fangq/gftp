I am pleased to announce the availability of gFTP 2.0.18. Here is a

please see the ChangeLog file that is included with the source distribution.

* Added support for the FSP protocol (http://fsp.sourceforge.net/)
* SSH2: Fixed segfault that could occur when renaming a file (bug introduced
  in 2.0.18rc1)
* SSH2: Fixes for parsing the directory listing from the commercial SSH server

  SITE UTIME commands

  before it is displayed
