Changes from 2.0.16 to 2.0.17

* Separated out more of the UI independent code in the GTK+ and Text ports and
  created a user interface common repository. Cleaned up some of the existing
  GTK+ code. The GTK+ port can now be controlled from a command line interface
  in the GUI. There is an option you have to enable in the options dialog for
  this. (enable manual commands in GUI)
* Added support for the FTPS protocol. The control connection is the only
  one encrypted at the moment.
* When viewing/editing a file, the temporary file that is created is created
  with the same extension as the remote file so that syntax highlighting works
* File transfers can be resumed/skipped/overwritten in the text port and
  whenever files are dropped on gftp in the GTK+ port.
* FTP: Added support for MVS directory listings
* FTP: Fix for FXP transfers
* SSH2: fix for resuming uploads
* Added option to show the transfer status in the title bar.
* Added option to disable IPV6 support.
* Fixed the wrong date being displayed when a file was modified last year
* 64 bit cleanups. This also fixed a SSH segfault that was happening on
  FreeBSD
* Look for the .gmo translation files in the proper directory
* If a bookmarked site has it's password saved in the config file, then the
  passwords are written out in a scrambled format. This isn't secure, but it'll
  prevent someone from casually looking over your shoulder and seeing your
  password. I still do not recommend saving your passwords to disk.
* Fix for systems that do not support the %'ld format argument
* The startup directory option is now expanded so that an option like
  ~/src can be specified
* New language translations and updates (ca cs de ga hr hu nl pt_BR sr sr@Latn
  ta th)
* Many other small changes and improvements. See the ChangeLog file in the
  distribution for a detailed list of changes.

Changes from 2.0.15 to 2.0.16

* Fixed bug where the local directory listing was not updated when
  connecting to a bookmarked site.
* Fix for Novell directory paths (//share/directory)
* Local: If there is a dangling symlink in the local directory, not all of
  the files were being shown.
* FTP: Fixed rename bug
* FTP: Fixed editing the FTP proxy config in the FTP port.
* FTP: Better error checking when establishing the data connection.
* FTP: File transfers are aborted correctly. You will not lose your connection
  to the remote server.
* FTP: Ascii file transfers fix.
* HTTP: Fixed parsing some chunked file transfers.
* SSH: Fixed crash when deleting subdirectories.
* When editing remote files, and if the current directory is changed on the
  remote server, make sure the file is still uploaded to the proper location.
* When editing a remote file, if the connection to the remote server times out,
  immediately reconnect when the file is uploaded.
* DND cleanups
* If the source is compiled with -D_GNU_SOURCE, then use the current style
  for the current locale to separate numbers.
* In some cases, if the remote_charset is defined for the remote host, convert
  the current string from UTF8 to the users remote character set.
* Fixed Cray directory directory listings. Also, some UNIX directory listings
  that had files with multiple spaces were being mistaken for Cray directory
  listings.
* The README/FAQ is now stored in Docbook format.
* New language translations and updates (az bn el es hr it ja nl no pt ro sk sr)
* Many other small changes and improvements. See the ChangeLog file in the
  distribution for a detailed list of changes.

Changes from 2.0.15rc2 to 2.0.15

* FTP: Fixes for selecting ASCII/Binary transfers
* Fixed crash when deleting files in the GTK+ port
* Fixed parsing directory listings that have timestamps that are not in the 
  current locale.
* More largefile support fixes.
* Updated translations (cs, pl, sr, sr@Latn, sv)

Changes from 2.0.15rc1 to 2.0.15rc2

* Largefile (>2.1GB) fixes. 
* When resuming files, look up the right option name. gFTP would bail out
  whenever it couldn't look up the right option.
* Fixes to the permissions of files when they are first transfered. New files 
  are created with the mode 0644 & ~umask.
* Change to the proper local directory when one was enabled with a bookmark.
* Fixed crash that would occur in the options dialog when you hit Apply, then 
  OK.
* Fixed possible division by 0 when transfering a file.
* Fixed double free of a gftp_file structure member (utf8_file). This was not
  present in 2.0.14.
* FreeBSD PTY and password prompt fixes.
* Detect write errors properly.
* Added --info argument to the command line. This will give some information
  about how gFTP was compiled.

Changes from 2.0.14 to 2.0.15rc1

* I18N improvements in GTK+ 2.0 port. If the remote server is not returning 
  output in UTF8, it will first attempt to convert it from the local character
  set and if that fails it will try the character sets listed in the 
  remote_charsets option.
* Added an improved internal configuration interface. You can now override just
  about any option in the bookmarks dialog for a particular site. 
* Each protocol that gFTP supports is now completely self contained in it's own
  file. So, if gFTP doesn't support your favorite protocol, it should be pretty
  easy to add support
* When you attempt to connect to a site and there is a fatal error, gFTP will 
  abort properly and no longer keep trying to log back into the server.
* Fixes for transferring files greater than 2.1GB.
* Improved throttling of file transfers.
* Added support to expire cache entries after a particular period of time.
* FTP: Added IPV6 support. gFTP is almost 100% IPV6 compatible. If you are not 
  using a proxy server, you will not run into any issues. The list of local 
  networks to not use the proxy server is still currently IPV4 only.
* FTP: Added ability to parse VMS directory listings.
* FTP: The firewall_* options were renamed to ftp_proxy_* for better 
  consistency with the other protocols.
* SSH2: More informative error messages when the initial connection to the 
  remote server fails. You should hopefully not see those "Messages size too 
  big" error messages anymore.
* SSH2: Improved the PTY interface.
* Removed legacy SSH protocol. THe SSH2 protocol is now the only SSH protocol
  supported. You had to enable an option in 2.0.14 to be able to use this 
  protocol.
* HTTP: Lots of improvements to this protocol. 
* Added support for the HTTPS protocol. I added a generic SSL layer to the code
  so that other SSL protocols can be easily added.
* The bookmarks and configuration file is now only written if something changed
  during this session.
* Build fixes for various platforms
* Lots of cleanups and improvements to the core library. Also lots of bug fixes
  throughout the code.
* New language translations and updates (am ar ca cs es fr hu ja mk ms nl pl 
  pt pt_BR ru sr sr@Latn sv tr uk zh_TW). Thanks to everybody that has 
  contributed language updates!

  a hostname entered on the toolbar, it will connect to that host. Otherwise
  it will bring up the OpenURL dialog

  remote window automagically becomes cached, and the file transfer will use
  the same connection. It will only open a second connection when it has to.
* Added support to be able to drag urls from Netscape to the Open URL button
  on the toolbar. Also cleaned up the drag and drop code.
* Added drop down history box on the local and remote directory entry widget

    file to type 100.
  * Since gFTP uses a bookmarks menu now, you will have to change your 
    host= lines. A line in the old config file will have:
    host=Debian Sites:Debian:ftp.debian.org:21:/debian:anonymous:@EMAIL@:1
    You will have to change it to something like:
    host=Debian Sites/Debian:ftp.debian.org:21:/debian:anonymous:@EMAIL@:1
    The first column is the menu path. You can have
    Menu/Submenu/Submenu/Debian in order to nest items into submenus.
